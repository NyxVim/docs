## LSP Configuration

### Clean LSPConfig Syntax

If you have multiple servers configured in your LSPConfig, you can use a table and loop through them for a cleaner syntax:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Clean LSPConfig
local configs = require "nyxvim.configs.lspconfig"

local servers = {
  html = {},
  awk_ls = {},
  bashls = {},

  pyright = {
    settings = {
      python = {
        analysis = {
          autoSearchPaths = true,
          typeCheckingMode = "basic",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

for name, opts in pairs(servers) do
  opts.on_init = configs.on_init
  opts.on_attach = configs.on_attach
  opts.capabilities = configs.capabilities

  require("lspconfig")[name].setup(opts)
end
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  This approach makes it easier to manage multiple LSP servers and keeps your configuration DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
</Tip>

## Terminal Customization

### Dynamic Terminal Padding

For a better visual experience, you can dynamically adjust terminal padding when NyxVim is opened or closed:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Dynamic Padding
local autocmd = vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd

autocmd("VimEnter", {
  command = ":silent !kitty @ set-spacing padding=0 margin=0",
})

autocmd("VimLeavePre", {
  command = ":silent !kitty @ set-spacing padding=20 margin=10",
})
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  This example is specific to the Kitty terminal. Adjust the commands accordingly for other terminal emulators.
</Warning>

## Vim Enhancements

### Restore Cursor Position

This autocmd will restore the cursor position when reopening a file:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Restore Cursor
local autocmd = vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd

autocmd("BufReadPost", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    local line = vim.fn.line "'\""
    if
      line > 1
      and line <= vim.fn.line "$"
      and vim.bo.filetype ~= "commit"
      and vim.fn.index({ "xxd", "gitrebase" }, vim.bo.filetype) == -1
    then
      vim.cmd 'normal! g`"'
    end
  end,
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## WSL-Specific Configurations

### Clipboard in WSL without xclip

For WSL users, you can use the Windows clipboard for the `+` and `*` registers without xclip:

<CodeGroup>

```lua WSL Clipboard
vim.g.clipboard = {
  name = 'WslClipboard',
  copy = {
    ['+'] = 'clip.exe',
    ['*'] = 'clip.exe',
  },
  paste = {
    ['+'] = 'pwsh.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
    ['*'] = 'pwsh.exe -c [Console]::Out.Write($(Get-Clipboard -Raw).tostring().replace("`r", ""))',
  },
  cache_enabled = 0,
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  If you're using the default PowerShell, replace `pwsh.exe` with `powershell.exe`.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Modularize Your Config**: Keep your configuration organized by splitting it into logical modules.
2. **Comment Your Code**: Add comments to explain complex configurations or non-obvious choices.
3. **Use Lua**: Prefer Lua over Vimscript for better performance and maintainability.
4. **Lazy Load**: Whenever possible, lazy load plugins to improve startup time.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with these recipes:

1. Ensure that you've placed the code in the correct configuration file.
2. Check for any conflicting plugins or existing configurations.
3. Verify that all required plugins are installed and up to date.
4. Use `:checkhealth` to diagnose potential issues.
