## General Questions

<Accordion title="What is NyxVim?">
  NyxVim is a feature-rich, customizable Neovim distribution designed to enhance your coding experience. It combines carefully selected plugins with custom features to provide a powerful yet user-friendly editing environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is NyxVim suitable for beginners?">
  While NyxVim is designed to be user-friendly, it's recommended to have some familiarity with Vim/Neovim basics before using it. We provide a [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide to help new users.
</Accordion>

## Setup and Configuration

<Accordion title="How do I install NyxVim?">
  Please refer to our [Installation Guide](/installation) for detailed instructions on how to install NyxVim on your system.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remove base46?">
  No, NyxVim hard-depends on base46 for its theming capabilities. If you prefer not to use base46, you might want to consider a different Neovim configuration.
</Accordion>

## Appearance and Theming

<Accordion title="Icons not working">
  To ensure icons display correctly:
  
  1. Set up a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home) as your terminal's default font.
  2. Make sure your terminal supports Unicode characters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I set highlight groups?">
  To modify highlight groups:
  
  - Use `hl_override` in your configuration to override existing highlight groups.
  - Use `hl_add` to add new highlight groups.
  
  For detailed information, check our [Theming Documentation](/configuration/theming#hl_override).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I customize theme colors?">
  Use the `changed_themes` option in your configuration file. For more details, refer to our [Theming Documentation](/configuration/theming#customize_themes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I create custom local base46 themes?">
  To create a custom local theme in base46 format:
  
  1. Create a file at `/lua/themes/mytheme.lua`.
  2. Define your theme colors in this file.
  
  For more information, check the [base46 documentation](https://github.com/NyxVim/base46/blob/main/README.md).
</Accordion>

## Keybindings and Mappings

<Accordion title="How do I map Ctrl + o / i keys?">
  In NyxVim, `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` are mapped by default, which can interfere with `<C-i>` mapping. To map these keys:
  
  1. Either disable `<Tab>` in your custom mappings file, or
  2. Configure your terminal to send the correct key codes.
  
  For example, in Alacritty:
  
  ```yaml
  key_bindings:
    - { key: I, mods: Control, chars: "\x1b[105;6u" }
  ```
  
  **Note**: Keymaps in NyxVim are case-sensitive. To delete a mapping, use lowercase `<tab>`:
  
  ```lua
  local nomap = vim.keymap.del
  nomap("n", "<tab>")
  ```
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="NyxVim's color is weird">
  This issue often occurs with terminals that don't support true color. If you're using the default macOS terminal, consider switching to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or another terminal that supports true color.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Syntax highlighting not working">
  Ensure you have installed the Treesitter parser for the language you're working with. For example, to install the Lua parser:
  
  ```
  :TSInstall lua
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CursorLine not showing">
  By default, we set the cursorline to only highlight the number. To have the entire line highlighted, add this to your configuration:
  
  ```lua
  vim.o.cursorlineopt = "both"
  ```
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep NyxVim and its plugins updated regularly for the best experience and latest features.
2. **Backup Your Config**: Always backup your configuration before making significant changes.
3. **Gradual Customization**: Start with the default configuration and customize gradually to understand each change's impact.
4. **Read the Docs**: Familiarize yourself with our documentation to make the most of NyxVim's features.
