## Getting Started

NyxVim is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

<Info>
  Before you start contributing, please make sure you've read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NyxVim/NyxVim/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions, including:

- Bug fixes

</Tip>

## Making a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines:

1. **Be Descriptive**: Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes.
2. **Stay Focused**: Keep your PR focused on a single issue or feature.
3. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure your code adheres to our coding standards.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.

<Warning>
  NyxVim aims to be less bloated. PRs for existing plugin enhancements, new features using existing plugins, bug fixes, and corrections are more encouraged than adding new plugins.
</Warning>

## Code Style

We use StyLua for code formatting. Please ensure your code is formatted according to our StyLua configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```toml .stylua.toml
column_width = 120
line_endings = "Unix"
indent_type = "Spaces"
indent_width = 2
quote_style = "AutoPreferDouble"
call_parentheses = "None"
collapse_simple_statement = "Always"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Run StyLua on your code before submitting a PR to ensure consistent formatting.
