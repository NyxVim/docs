## Overview

Key mappings are a crucial part of any Neovim configuration, allowing you to customize your editing experience. NyxVim provides a set of default mappings and makes it easy to add or modify them.

<Info>
  The default mappings are defined in the [NyxVim mappings file](https://github.com/NyxVim/NyxVim/blob/main/lua/nyxvim/mappings.lua).
</Info>

## Mapping Conventions

NyxVim uses the following conventions for key names:

<CodeGroup>

```markdown Key Conventions
- `<C>` -> Ctrl
- `<leader>` -> Space
- `<A>` -> Alt
- `<S>` -> Shift
```

</CodeGroup>

## Mapping Format

NyxVim uses `vim.keymap.set` for defining mappings. Here's the basic syntax:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Basic Mapping
vim.keymap.set(mode, lhs, rhs, opts)
```

</CodeGroup>

Where:
- `mode`: The mode where the mapping is active (e.g., "n" for normal mode)
- `lhs`: The key combination to trigger the mapping
- `rhs`: The command or function to execute
- `opts`: Additional options (optional)

<Tip>
  The `desc` option in `opts` is used by NvCheatsheet to document the mapping. The first word in `desc` will be used as the group heading.
</Tip>

## Example Mappings

Here are some example mappings to illustrate different use cases:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Simple Command Mapping
local map = vim.keymap.set

map("n", "<leader>ff", "<cmd> Telescope find_files <cr>", { desc = "Find files" })
```

```lua Multiple Modes Mapping
map({ "i", "n" }, "<C-k>", "<Up>", { desc = "Move up" })
```

```lua Lua Function Mapping
map("n", "<A-i>", function()
   -- Your Lua code here
end, { desc = "Terminal toggle floating" })
```

```lua Disable Mapping
local nomap = vim.keymap.del

nomap("i", "<C-k>")
nomap("n", "<C-k>")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Extending Default Configurations

You can extend default configurations for plugins like Telescope. Here's an example:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Extend Telescope Config
{
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  opts = function()
    local conf = require "nyxvim.configs.telescope"

    conf.defaults.mappings.i = {
      ["<C-j>"] = require("telescope.actions").move_selection_next,
      ["<Esc>"] = require("telescope.actions").close,
    }

    return conf
  end,
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  LSP and gitsigns mappings won't be overridden by the above methods because they are lazy loaded. Place LSP mappings in an `LspAttach` autocmd or right after your `on_attach` function.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Try to maintain consistency with existing mappings.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names in the `desc` option for clarity.
3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Be careful not to override important default mappings.
4. **Mode-Specific**: Use mode-specific mappings when appropriate.

## Troubleshooting

If your mappings aren't working as expected:

1. Check for conflicts with other plugins or mappings.
2. Verify the mode in which you're trying to use the mapping.
3. Use `:verbose map <key>` to see if the mapping is being overridden.

<Tip>
  Use the NvCheatsheet (accessible via `<leader>ch`) to view all your current mappings at a glance.
