## Introduction to LSP

Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a powerful feature that provides intelligent code completion, diagnostics, and more. NyxVim makes it easy to configure and use LSP for various programming languages.

<Info>
  Before diving into LSP configuration, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the basics of LSP and its benefits for development.
</Info>

## Setting Up LSP Servers

To get started with LSP configuration in NyxVim:

1. Review the [lspconfig repository](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) for general LSP setup information.
2. Check the [configs.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md) to ensure your language's LSP server is supported.

### Plugin Configuration

To modify the `lspconfig` setup, add the following to your plugin configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Plugin Table
{
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
   config = function()
      require("nyxvim.configs.lspconfig").defaults()
      require "configs.lspconfig"
   end,
},
```

</CodeGroup>

### LSP Server Configuration

Create a file named `configs/lspconfig.lua` with the following structure:

<CodeGroup>

```lua configs/lspconfig.lua
local configs = require("nyxvim.configs.lspconfig")

local on_attach = configs.on_attach
local on_init = configs.on_init
local capabilities = configs.capabilities

local lspconfig = require "lspconfig"
local servers = { "html", "cssls", "clangd"}

for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
  lspconfig[lsp].setup {
    on_init = on_init,
    on_attach = on_attach,
    capabilities = capabilities,
  }
end
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The loop in the configuration above allows you to set up multiple LSP servers efficiently. Without it, you'd need to manually configure each server individually.
</Tip>

## Mason.nvim Integration

[mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) is a powerful tool for managing LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters in Neovim.

To install LSP servers and tools using Mason:

1. Open NyxVim
2. Run the command `:MasonInstallAll`

<Warning>
  After installing binaries with Mason, you'll need to configure them to work properly with LSP, conform.nvim, nvim-lint, nvim-dap, etc. The specific configuration depends on what you've installed.
</Warning>

<Info>
  NyxVim provides language configuration for Lua out of the box. For other languages, you'll need to set up the configuration yourself.
</Info>

## Customizing LSP Behavior

You can customize LSP behavior by modifying the `on_attach` function or adjusting server-specific settings. Here's an example of how you might customize the HTML LSP server:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Custom HTML LSP Config
lspconfig.html.setup {
  on_attach = on_attach,
  capabilities = capabilities,
  filetypes = { "html", "templ" },  -- Add support for templ files
  init_options = {
    configurationSection = { "html", "css", "javascript" },
    embeddedLanguages = {
      css = true,
      javascript = true
    },
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with LSP:

1. Check the `:LspInfo` command output for server status
2. Verify that the LSP server is installed correctly
3. Review your configuration for any errors

<Tip>
  Use `:checkhealth` in NyxVim to diagnose potential issues with your setup, including LSP-related problems.
</Tip>
