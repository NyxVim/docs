## Introduction to Snippets

Snippets are powerful tools that allow you to quickly insert pre-defined code templates into your editor. NyxVim uses the `LuaSnip` plugin for handling snippets, providing a flexible and efficient snippet management system.

<Info>
  By default, NyxVim includes the `friendly-snippets` plugin, which offers a wide range of snippets for many programming languages.
</Info>

## LuaSnip Overview

[LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) is a snippet engine for Neovim written in Lua. It offers advanced features like:

- Dynamic snippets
- Conditional expansion
- Nested snippets
- And more!

<Tip>
  To get the most out of LuaSnip, we recommend reading the [official LuaSnip documentation](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#loaders).
</Tip>

## Configuring Snippet Paths

NyxVim provides global variables to specify the paths for your custom snippets. You can set these in your configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```lua VSCode Snippets
-- For VSCode-style snippets (JSON files)
vim.g.vscode_snippets_path = "your/snippets/path"
```

```lua SnipMate Snippets
-- For SnipMate-style snippets
vim.g.snipmate_snippets_path = "your/snippets/path"
```

```lua Lua Snippets
-- For Lua-format snippets
vim.g.lua_snippets_path = vim.fn.stdpath "config" .. "/lua/lua_snippets"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  `vim.fn.stdpath("config")` returns the path to your Neovim configuration folder.
</Info>

## Creating Custom Snippets

To create your own snippets, you can use any of the supported formats (VSCode, SnipMate, or Lua). Here's an example of a Lua snippet:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Example Lua Snippet
local ls = require("luasnip")
local s = ls.snippet
local t = ls.text_node
local i = ls.insert_node

ls.add_snippets("all", {
  s("ternary", {
    -- equivalent to "${1:cond} ? ${2:then} : ${3:else}"
    i(1, "cond"), t(" ? "), i(2, "then"), t(" : "), i(3, "else")
  })
})
```

</CodeGroup>

This snippet creates a ternary operator template that can be used in any file type.

## Using Snippets

To use a snippet:

1. Enter insert mode
2. Type the snippet trigger
3. Press the expansion key (usually `<Tab>`)

<Tip>
  You can use the `:LuaSnipListAvailable` command to see all available snippets for the current file type.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Organize snippets**: Keep your snippets organized by language or purpose.
2. **Use descriptive names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for your snippets.
3. **Leverage dynamic snippets**: Use Lua's power to create dynamic, context-aware snippets.
4. **Keep snippets DRY**: Avoid duplicating code in your snippets.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with snippets:

1. Check that the snippet path is correctly set
2. Ensure the snippet file is in the correct format
3. Verify that the snippet trigger is correct
4. Use `:LuaSnipListAvailable` to check if the snippet is recognized
