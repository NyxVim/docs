## Overview

NyxVim leverages [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for efficient plugin management. This powerful tool allows for lazy loading and easy configuration of plugins.

<Info>
  Check out the [list of default plugins](https://github.com/NyxVim/NyxVim/tree/main/lua/nyxvim/plugins) included in NyxVim.
</Info>

## Lazy Loading

We employ lazy loading for approximately 95% of our plugins to optimize startup time. We strongly recommend that you follow this practice when adding your own plugins.

<Warning>
  Failing to lazy load plugins can significantly slow down NyxVim's startup time.
</Warning>

To implement lazy loading effectively:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [lazy.nvim plugin specs](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-plugin-spec).
2. Utilize available options for lazy loading in your plugin configurations.
3. Always strive to lazy-load plugins when possible.

## Managing Plugins

All default NyxVim plugins are set with `lazy = true`. If you want a plugin to load at startup, you need to set `lazy = false`.

### Plugin Configuration

Create a file named `plugins/custom.lua` (or any other name) with the following structure:

```lua
local plugins = {
  -- Your plugin configurations go here
}

return plugins
```

### Plugin Configuration Examples

Here are some examples of how to configure plugins:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Load at Startup
{ "elkowar/yuck.vim", lazy = false }
```

```lua Disable a Plugin
{ "folke/which-key.nvim", enabled = false }
```

```lua Lazy Load with Command
{
  "Pocco81/TrueZen.nvim",
  cmd = { "TZAtaraxis", "TZMinimalist" },
  config = function()
    require "configs.truezen" -- example path
  end,
}
```

```lua Extend Default Options
{
  "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
  opts = {
    ensure_installed = {"html", "css", "bash"},
  },
}
```

```lua Function-based Configuration
{
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  opts = function()
    local conf = require "nyxvim.configs.telescope"
    conf.defaults.mappings.i = {
      ["<C-j>"] = require("telescope.actions").move_selection_next,
      ["<Esc>"] = require("telescope.actions").close,
    }
    return conf
  end,
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Lazy Load**: Always try to lazy load plugins when possible.
2. **Minimal Configuration**: Only override necessary options to keep configurations clean.
3. **Use Built-in Features**: Leverage lazy.nvim's built-in features for efficient plugin management.
4. **Document Your Changes**: Add comments to explain any complex configurations or overrides.

<Tip>
  Remember to run `:Lazy sync` after making changes to your plugin configurations to ensure all changes are applied.
